-> I first downloaded the raw data and copied it in another sheet(working sheet) to clean it.

-> Then I made pivot tables and charts using the working sheet. 

-> Finally, created the dashboard using the charts and I also inserted slicer to make the dashboard interactive. \


The dashboard above is the final result but do checkout the xlsx file to see the entire work. I'll appreciate your feedback :)

Also, If you want to give this exercise a try, here's the link to the [dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx).


Happy learning!
